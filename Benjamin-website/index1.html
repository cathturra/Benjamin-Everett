<h1> About </h1>
<p> Benjamin Everett's hybrid landscapes mix the traditions of photography and painting. His images are captured through extensive travel and wilderness experience, combined with scale and sculptural experimentation.<br> <br>
Beginning in the field, Benjamin searches out unique locations that lend themselves to creative play. He then collects a series of detailed photographs that represent fascinations with some unique aspect of the location; light on form, texture, color or composition. Often these details are symbolic of natural forces or the synchronicity of repeated themes unique to a location. Later in the studio, these collected elements become the foundation for play and interactivity, a way to engage and re-experience a scene. The final image functions much like the landscape of memories or dreams, an abstraction where multiple moments combine, scale and time transform.<br> <br>
Benjamin's major artistic influences outside of the fine arts include electronic music, where both created and sampled sound are seen as the creative building blocks for a song, and sports such as skiing, surfing and sailing, where the forces of nature are seen as an invitation to play. He is a recipient of the prestigious Hasselblad Masters Award for landscapes.
